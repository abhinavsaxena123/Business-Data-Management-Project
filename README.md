# Business-Data-Management-Project 
This project provides a data-driven analysis for Greenaway Enterprises LLP, a B2B trading firm facing significant operational challenges. 

## Project Stages ðŸ“ƒ

This project was executed in three distinct phases, mirroring a standard data analysis lifecycle from conception to conclusion.

### Stage 1: Project Proposal & Problem Identification
This initial phase involved direct engagement with the business owner to understand their operational model and pain points. I defined the scope, formulated the three core problem statements, outlined the analytical approach, and established a project timeline.

### Stage 2: Mid-Term Analysis & Preliminary Findings
In the second stage, the collected sales and purchase data was cleaned, preprocessed, and subjected to initial descriptive and diagnostic analysis. This phase focused on validating the problem statements with preliminary data visualizations and statistical summaries, confirming the initial hypotheses regarding client concentration and inventory issues.

### Stage 3: Final Analysis, Interpretation & Recommendations
The final phase involved a deep-dive analysis, including ABC and Pareto classifications and time-series comparisons. The results were interpreted to extract meaningful business insights. This stage culminated in the development of a comprehensive, data-driven solution framework and a set of actionable recommendations for the business owner.

## Data-Driven Problem Solving for a Growing Trading and Distribution Business

#### Project Context: Online BS in Data Science & Applications - IIT Madras

This project is a core component of the Business Data Management course in the Online BS Degree in Data Science program from IIT Madras. 
The assignment required students to engage directly with a real-world business, understand its operations, identify critical challenges through conversations with the owner, collect primary data, and perform a thorough analysis to provide actionable, data-driven recommendations.

* This project is a practical application of data analysis principles to solve tangible problems faced by a growing enterprise, using real-world sales and purchase data.

### 1. Business Overview & Problem Statement

Business: Greenaway Enterprises LLP, a B2B trading and distribution firm based in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. The company supplies chemical, plastic, and rubber-based raw materials to small-scale manufacturers.

Challenge: Through direct consultation with the business owner, we identified that despite growth, the company was facing increasing operational pressures that threatened its long-term stability and profitability. The analysis of their operations and financial data pinpointed three core challenges:

1. High-Risk Client Concentration: An intuitive feeling that a vast majority of revenue was dependent on a very small number of clients, creating a significant risk if a key account was lost.

2. Inefficient Inventory Management: A noticeable increase in capital tied up in stock and rising carrying costs, without a clear system for managing inventory levels against sales velocity.

3. Profit Margin Erosion: A struggle to maintain consistent profitability due to the high volatility of raw material purchase prices, which were not being effectively passed on through sales pricing.

### 2. Objective & Approach
The primary goal of this project was to validate these problems with data and develop a strategic framework to address them. The approach involved:

* Data Collection: Gathering 12-18 months of historical sales and purchase data directly from the company.
* Data Analysis: Using Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, processing, analysis, and visualization.
* Solution Development: Translating analytical insights into a set of clear, actionable recommendations for the business owner.

### 3. Analysis & Key Findings

#### Finding 1: Severe Client Dependency Confirmed
* Method: A Pareto (80/20) Analysis was conducted on the sales data.

* Insight: The analysis confirmed the owner's suspicion, revealing that approximately 80% of the company's revenue was generated by just 20% of its clients. This over-reliance on a few key accounts posed a substantial risk to revenue stability.

#### Finding 2: Quantified Inventory Inefficiency
* Method: An ABC Analysis was performed to classify inventory items based on their revenue contribution. Additionally, metrics like Days Inventory Outstanding (DIO) were calculated.

* Insight: The firm lacked a prioritized inventory system. High-value (Class A) items were not managed differently from low-value (Class C) items. The analysis identified slow-moving stock and a rising DIO, which directly translated to increased carrying costs and inefficient use of working capital.

#### Finding 3: Proof of Unprofitable Sales Periods
* Method: A time-series analysis comparing the average monthly purchase rate and average monthly sales rate for key raw materials.

* Insight: The data clearly showed several months where the average purchase cost of raw materials exceeded the average sales price. This proved the company was selling at a loss during periods of high price volatility because its static pricing model could not adapt to fluctuating input costs.

## 4. Data-Driven Solutions & Recommendations
Based on the findings, the following strategic framework was proposed to the business owner:

#### Solution 1: Implement a Client Diversification Strategy
* Recommendation: Actively nurture "next-tier" clients to grow their order value. Develop targeted marketing efforts to attract new clients in different segments to reduce the dependency on the top 20%.

#### Solution 2: Adopt an ABC Inventory Management System
* Recommendation: Manage inventory based on its ABC classification.

Class A Items: Implement rigorous tracking, tighter control, and regular reviews.

Class B Items: Use a standard reorder point system.

Class C Items: Use a simple, two-bin system to minimize management overhead.
This approach focuses resources on the most valuable stock, reducing carrying costs and freeing up capital.

#### Solution 3: Develop a Dynamic Pricing Model
* Recommendation: Move away from a static pricing list. Create a simple pricing model in Excel that links the selling price of a product directly to the latest purchase cost of its core raw materials, ensuring a consistent profit margin is maintained regardless of market volatility. It was also recommended to add clauses to client contracts allowing for price adjustments based on market rates.

## 5. Project Impact
This project provided Greenaway Enterprises LLP with a clear, data-backed roadmap to transition from a reactive to a proactive operational model. By implementing these recommendations, the business can mitigate significant financial risks, optimize cash flow, protect its profitability, and build a more stable foundation for future growth.
